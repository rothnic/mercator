# Task Backlog Index

Tasks are grouped by iteration and feature area. Always pick work from the earliest iteration that still has unfinished tasks unless a maintainer explicitly reprioritizes.

1. Review the [Task Working Agreement](README.md) to understand status updates and contribution etiquette.
2. Open the relevant iteration file below and choose the first **`Todo`** task in priority order. Update the status to `In Progress` when you start and `Done` once your PR is merged.

| Iteration | Status | Task File |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| I01 – MVP Product Page Loop | In Progress | [iteration-01-mvp.md](iteration-01-mvp.md) |
| I02 – Live Products & Canarying | Draft | [iteration-02-live-products.md](iteration-02-live-products.md) |

If new work is discovered, add it as a task in the appropriate iteration with clear dependencies rather than editing vision or architecture docs.
