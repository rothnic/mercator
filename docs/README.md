# Mercator Documentation

This folder captures the stable product vision, architecture, and delivery plan for the Mercator project.

## Document Map

- [Product Vision](product/vision.md) – durable goals and scope that rarely change.
- [Architecture Overview](architecture/system-overview.md) – core components, agents, and interfaces.
- [Delivery Plan](plan/iterations.md) – iteration roadmap and feature sequencing.
- [Task Backlog](tasks/index.md) – actionable work items grouped by iteration/feature.
- [Decisions](decisions/README.md) – architecture decision records (ADRs) for key choices.
- [Quality Observations](quality/observations.md) – recorded debt, regression history, and workflow gaps.

When adding new documentation, prefer updating the most specific file instead of duplicating information. Link related docs to keep navigation simple for future agents.
